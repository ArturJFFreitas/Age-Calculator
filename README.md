# Age Calculator

By Artur Freitas, arturfreitas09@gmail.com 06/09/2022

An age calculator was developed to find out the exact age (to the hundreads) at a certain selected time.
The repository has only a MATLAB script.
To work with this script these are the variables that should be modified:
  * DOB - a matrix with the starting point of the age calculation, structured in format "DD  MM  YYYY"
  * Draft - a vector with the end point of the age calculation, structured in format "DD  MM  YYYY"

The results will be in the 'ID' variable.
